# Advent of Code 2024

This is my attempt to learn embedded rust using BBC micro:bit V2.

What I try to learn:
- Embedded rust:
    - How it works
    - Development environment
    - Ecosystem
- `#![no_std]` rust
- Data structure through reimplementation of:
    - `microbit-v2` crate
    - `heapless` crate
- Algorithm
